        For this recipe I took my favorite homemade pizza crust recipe and
        halved it, to make one batch of breadsticks. You could make the full
        recipe for two batches of breadsticks, or use half the dough to make one
        pizza, and the other half to make cheesy breadsticks.
      </p>
      <p>Some possible Variations include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cinnamon sugar breadsticks:</strong> make the dough, form the
          breadsticks, then top with ½ stick of melted butter. Mix ½ cup sugar
          with 2 Tablespoons ground cinnamon and sprinkle over the buttered
          breadsticks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Swap the cheese:</strong> feel free to substitute any kind of
          shredded cheese you like.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Make pizza:</strong> This breadstick recipe is the same as my

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1 1/8 tsp</strong> active dry yeast</li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> granulated sugar</li>
        <li><strong>3/4 cup</strong> warm water</li>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 Tbsp</strong> olive oil</li>
        <li><strong>3/4 tsp</strong> salt</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 tsp</strong> white vinegar</li>
        <li><strong>1 ½ - 2 cups</strong> bread flour or all-purpose flour</li>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 Tbsp</strong> salted butter</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li><strong>1/3 cup</strong> freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li><strong>1 1/4 cups</strong> shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large bowl or stand mixer combine ½ cup of the warm water with
          the sugar and yeast. Stir to combine and let rest for 5 minutes. Add
          the remaining ¼ cup warm water, olive oil, salt and vinegar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Begin mixing on medium-low speed and gradually add the flour --knead
          for a few minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic (it should
          be slightly sticky, but not so sticky that it sticks to your clean
          fingertip). Mine is usually ready with 1 ½ cups flour) Cover the bowl
          with a dry towel and allow to rest in a warm place for 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 475 degrees F with a pizza stone inside or upside down
          cookie sheet inside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gently punch the dough down. Place a large piece of parchment paper on
          your counter and use your hands (or a rolling pin, but it's easier
          with your hands) to spread the dough into a rectangle about ⅓ inch
          thick.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix melted butter and garlic in a small bowl then spread mixture
          evenly over dough, all the way to the edges. Top with parmesan and
          mozzarella cheeses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the dough (still on the parchment paper) onto the hot pizza
          stone in the oven. Bake for 8-12 minutes or until golden and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with dipping sauces like marinara sauce or ranch.</li>
