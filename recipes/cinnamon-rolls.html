        The BEST cinnamon rolls in the WORLD. Big, fluffy, soft and absolutely
        delicious. You’ll never go back to any other recipe once you try this
        one! This cinnamon roll recipe includes options to make them overnight
        or ahead of time and even freeze them.

        This cinnamon roll recipe doesn't require a ton of ingredients, but it
        does require love, patience and dedication to the true recipe — meaning
        don't deter from the original! These are called the best cinnamon rolls
        for a reason, and that requires following the recipe as instructed.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>3/4 cup</strong> warm milk (whole milk or 2% preferred) (110
          degrees F)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2 1/4 tsp</strong> quick rise or active yeast (1/4-ounce
          package yeast)
        </li>
        <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> granulated sugar</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1</strong> egg plus <strong>1</strong> egg yolk, at room
          temperature
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1/4</strong> cup butter, melted (I prefer salted, but unsalted
          works, too)

        <li><strong>3/4 tsp</strong> salt</li>

          works)
        </li>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 Tbsp</strong> ground cinnamon</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> butter, softened</li>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Warm milk to around 110 degrees F. I like to do this by placing milk
          in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving it for 40-45 seconds. It
          should be like warm bath water. Transfer warm milk to the bowl of an
          electric mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Add in sugar, egg, egg yolk
          and melted butter. Mix until well combined. Next stir in flour and
          salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8
          minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If
          it's TOO sticky (meaning it's sticking to the bottom of the mixer, add
          in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don't want to use an
          electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10
          minutes on a well-floured surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and
          a warm towel. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour to 1 ½ hours, or until
          doubled in size. This may more or less time depending the humidity and
          temperature in your home.
        </li>
        <li>
          After dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured
          surface and roll out into a 14x9 inch rectangle. Spread softened
          butter over dough, leaving a ¼ inch margin at the far side of the
          dough.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands
          to sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar
          mixture into the butter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tightly roll dough up, starting from the 9-inch side and place seam
          side down making sure to seal the edges of the dough as best you can.
          You will probably need to cut off about an inch off the ends of the
          dough as the ends won't be as full of cinnamon sugar as we'd want it
          to be.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife or floss. You should
          get 9 large pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 inch baking pan or round 9 inch
          cake pan. (I also recommend lining the pan with parchment paper as
          well, in case any of the filling ends up leaking out.) Cover with
          plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30-45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake
          cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown
          on the edges. You want to underbake them a little so they stay soft in
          the middle, that’s why we want them just slightly golden brown. Allow
          them to cool for 5-10 minutes before frosting. Makes 9 cinnamon rolls.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To make the frosting:</strong> In the bowl of an electric
          mixer, combine cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and vanilla
          extract. Beat until smooth and fluffy. Spread over cinnamon rolls and
          serve immediately. Enjoy!
