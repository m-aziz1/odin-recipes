            Easy homemade chicken ramen, with a flavorful broth, roasted chicken,
            fresh veggies, lots of noodles, and a soft cooked egg. Inspired by
            traditional Japanese ramen, but on the table in under an hour.
        </p>
        <p>
            I opted for chicken instead of pork, but kept the rest of the ramen vibe
            somewhat traditional: a killer chicken soup base with garlic, ginger,
            shitake mushrooms and soy sauce, filled with squiggly ramen noodles and
            slices of succulent chicken, and topped with fresh spring onions and a
            soft-boiled egg.
        </p>
        <p>
            My version is on the table in less than an hour — and half that if you
            opt for store-bought chicken — and while it might not be completely
            authentic, it's a flavorful, comforting soup just in time for the
            unmistakably crisp, chilly autumn weather that these first days of
            October have ushered in.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook the chicken: Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken
                generously with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the
                chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and
                releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over
                and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until
                the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer the
                chicken to a plate and cover with foil until ready to serve.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the ramen broth: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat,
                until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for a few
                minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin, and stir to
                combine. Cook for another minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the stock, cover, and bring to boil. Remove the lid, and let
                simmer uncovered for 5 minutes, then add the dried mushrooms. Simmer
                gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the soft-boiled eggs: Fill a pot with enough water to cover the
                eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the
                fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a
                slightly-runny yoke) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yoke).
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes,
                transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Wait at
                least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel
                away the shell and slice in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to
                serve.
            </li>
            <li>
                Assemble the ramen bowls: Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño
                (if using). Slice the chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. When the
                eggs finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two
                large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. Top with the
                fresh scallions, jalapeño and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately.
            </li>
