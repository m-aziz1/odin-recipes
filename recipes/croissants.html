        This Homemade Croissants recipe is so buttery, flaky, and will make your

        Croissants are flaky, layered French pastry in the shape of a crescent.
        They're loved by everyone and for a good reason! We're talking
        cloud-like puff pastry, buttery, flaky, yeasty, chewy bread. It really
        is one of the most decadent things you can eat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Croissant dough gets its many layers as a result of “laminating” the
        dough. This means we are rolling and folding over and over, giving you
        many thin layers of dough and butter. As you bake them, the butter melts
        and gives off steam. This puffs each paper-thin layer of dough up giving
        your croissants hundreds of buttery layers.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 cups</strong> milk lukewarm</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> brown sugar packed</li>
        <li><strong>3 1/4 tsp</strong> active dry yeast</li>
        <li>
          <strong>3 1/4 cups</strong> all-purpose flour, up to 4 cups if needed
        </li>
        <li><strong>1 Tbsp</strong> salt</li>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 cups</strong> butter unsalted, cold</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> egg for egg wash</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Bloom the yeast:</strong> In the bowl of a mixer, add the warm
          milk, brown sugar, yeast and stir it with a fork slightly. Let it
          stand for about 5 minutes. If the yeast is good, the mixture will get
          all foamy as the yeast dissolves. It could take a bit longer but if
          your yeast does not dissolve, see recipe notes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Make the dough:</strong> Add the flour and salt to the bowl.
          Using the dough hook, mix on low speed for about 5 minutes until the
          dough is smooth and very soft. I used about 3 1/4 cups of flour, but
          if you need more because the dough is too sticky than just add more,
          about 1 tbsp at a time. You might want to start with 3 cups and add as
          needed. Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and knead for a couple
          more minutes on your working surface. The dough needs to be soft and
          slightly sticky. Place the dough back in the bowl, wrap it with
          plastic wrap and refrigerate it for an hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare the butter:</strong> While the dough is chilling,
          prepare the butter. Arrange the sticks of butter horizontally on a
          piece of plastic wrap. Cover the butter with another piece of plastic
          wrap. Pound and roll out on both sides until the butter forms a nice 8
          by 5 inch rectangle. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until
          ready to use.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Laminate the dough:</strong> Flour your work surface lightly
          then roll out the dough into a big rectangle that's about 16 by 10
          inches. Place the butter directly in the center of the dough and fold
          the dough as you would a letter, bottom third of dough over butter,
          then top third down over the dough. If you have any excess flour, make
          sure you brush that off.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn the dough so that the short side is nearest you and start rolling
          it another 16 by 10 inch rectangle. Fold in thirds like a letter
          again. This was the first fold. Wrap it up in plastic wrap and chill
          it for another hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat as above. With the short side near you, start rolling until you
          get another 16 by 10 inch rectangle. Fold it in thirds again, wrap and
          chill for another hour. Repeat this 3 more times so that it will make
          a total of 5 folds. After the last fold, refrigerate it over night or
          at least for 8 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shape croissants:</strong> Cut the dough in half, freeze half
          if you're only going to use half of it. Roll out each piece of dough
          into a long rectangle, so that it's about 1/4 of an inch in thickness.
          I found it easier if I cut the piece into 3 pieces, so that I work
          with 3 squares. Using a pizza cutter, cut each square into 4
          triangles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using one triangle at a time, start rolling from the wide side, at the
          same time, stretching the end of the triangle. Continue rolling the
          croissant, and as you'll notice because you stretched into a long
          piece, you'll be able to roll the croissant a few times.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat this with remaining dough and place the croissants on an
          ungreased baking sheet, with about 1 to 2 inches in between them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let the croissants sit for another hour, you'll notice they'll rise a
          bit, then brush them with egg wash. You can make the croissants ahead
          of time and refrigerate them for up to 18 hours before baking. If
          you're making them ahead, make sure to cover the baking sheet with
          plastic wrap.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bake croissants:</strong> Preheat your oven to 400 F degrees.
          Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the croissants for 8 to 12
          minutes at 400 F degrees then turn down the heat to 375 F degrees and
          bake them for another 8 to 12 minutes. You want to make sure they are
          nice and golden brown.
        </li>
